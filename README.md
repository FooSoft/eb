# Eb #

This is a fork of the last known release of eb (a.k.a. eblib, libeb), version
4.4.3. It includes fixes for the Windows operating system as well as a
capability to dump all data out of EPWING dictionaries (as opposed to simply
executing search queries).

This modified library exists mostly for use by the
[Zero-EPWING](https://foosoft.net/projects/zero-epwing/) project.
